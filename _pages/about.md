I am a master student of Biomedical Engineering at Tsinghua University, advised by [Prof.Peiwu Qin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yD3IOXkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). Prior to that, I completed my bachelor’s in Electronic and Information Engineering at China University of Mining and Technology, where I worked with [Prof.Meng Lei](https://faculty.cumt.edu.cn/LM123456789101112/zh_CN/index/167772/list/).

My current research interests include Bio photonics, Medical Imaging and Medical AI. Specifically, I am interested in (a) integrating an optical system for fundus imaging and refractive testing and (b) correcting microscopy aberrations of cell images by utilizing conditional diffusion model. Moreover, I am also focusing on (c) elimating microscopy aberration using conditional diffusion models.
